## 🎯 Original Vision

From the very beginning, the goal of TruePrice has been clear:

> **To build a full and accurate price comparison platform that helps users compare prices easily across multiple stores.**

The current version represents the foundation of that vision.

## 🔁 Why Redirection Is Used Today

As an independent platform, TruePrice operates under certain limitations common to early-stage projects.

At present:
- TruePrice guides users to relevant product listings on trusted platforms
- Prices are managed and updated directly by the respective sellers
- The focus is on accuracy, speed, and reliability

This approach allows TruePrice to remain functional and useful while deeper comparison capabilities are prepared for the future.

As TruePrice grows and gains user trust:
- Platform recognition improves
- Data accessibility opportunities increase
- Advanced comparison features become achievable

User support plays an important role in helping TruePrice evolve into a complete comparison platform.
